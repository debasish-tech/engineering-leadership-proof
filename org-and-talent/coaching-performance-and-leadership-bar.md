# Coaching, Performance, and the Leadership Bar

How I develop talent, manage performance, and maintain high standards.

## Philosophy

Great teams are not assembled; they are built. Hiring well is necessary but not sufficient. You have to develop people: give them stretch opportunities, provide feedback, and help them grow.

At the same time, not everyone will meet the bar. Managing performance honestly is a kindness, both to the individual and to the team.

## The Coaching Mindset

### Coaching vs Directing

**Directing:** "Do X."
**Coaching:** "What do you think we should do? Why?"

Directing is faster. Coaching builds capability. Default to coaching. Direct when speed is critical or the person lacks context.

### The 70-20-10 Model

People learn:
- 70% from on-the-job experience (stretch assignments, new challenges)
- 20% from others (feedback, mentorship, observation)
- 10% from formal training (courses, certifications)

Implication: development is mostly about the work, not training budgets. Give people hard problems. Let them struggle. Support them.

### Growth Requires Discomfort

If someone is comfortable, they are not growing. Growth happens at the edge of capability.

My job: give people problems slightly bigger than they think they can handle, and support them while they figure it out.

## Feedback

### Principles

**Direct.** Do not soften feedback so much that the message is lost. Say what you mean.

**Timely.** Give feedback close to the event. Waiting for the performance review is too late.

**Specific.** "You could communicate better" is not useful. "In yesterday's meeting, you interrupted the presenter three times" is useful.

**Behavioral.** Focus on actions, not personality. "You did X" not "You are X."

**Balanced.** Feedback is not just criticism. Recognition matters too.

### The SBI Framework

**Situation:** Where and when did this happen?
**Behavior:** What did the person do (observable)?
**Impact:** What was the result?

Example: "In the design review yesterday (situation), you proposed an alternative architecture that addressed the scaling concerns (behavior). That changed the direction of the project and probably saved us two months of rework (impact)."

### Receiving Feedback

Leaders who cannot receive feedback teach their teams not to give it. I model receiving feedback openly:
- Thank people for feedback, even when it is uncomfortable
- Ask clarifying questions
- Do not get defensive
- Follow up on what I changed based on the feedback

## Performance Management

### Setting Expectations

Clear expectations are the foundation of fair performance management. People cannot meet expectations they do not know.

At the start of each quarter or review period:
- What outcomes are expected?
- What does success look like?
- What are the stretch goals?
- How will we measure?

### Continuous Feedback

Performance conversations should not be surprises. If someone is underperforming, they should know long before the formal review.

Regular 1:1s are where this happens. Every 1:1 should include:
- What is going well?
- What could be better?
- What support do you need?

### The Performance Spectrum

| Category | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Exceeding | Consistently outperforms expectations | Recognize, promote, retain |
| Meeting | Meets expectations | Continue developing |
| Below | Not meeting expectations, but coachable | Performance plan with clear milestones |
| Failing | Not meeting expectations, not improving | Manage out |

Most people are in "meeting." That is fine. "Exceeding" is the exception, not the expectation.

### Managing Underperformance

Underperformance is uncomfortable. Avoiding it is worse.

**Step 1: Diagnose.**
Is the person capable but unmotivated? Motivated but lacking skills? Dealing with external issues? The intervention depends on the cause.

**Step 2: Clarify expectations.**
Make sure they know what "good" looks like. Specific, measurable expectations.

**Step 3: Provide support.**
What do they need to succeed? Training, mentorship, clearer direction, fewer distractions?

**Step 4: Set milestones.**
What do we need to see, by when? Weekly check-ins, not quarterly.

**Step 5: Make a decision.**
If they improve, great. If not, manage out. Do not let poor performance linger.

### Managing Out

If performance does not improve after honest effort, the right thing is to part ways.

**Do it humanely.** Give notice. Provide support (severance, references where honest, job search help).

**Do it quickly.** Once the decision is made, execute. Delay is cruel.

**Do it once.** If you managed someone out and they come back asking for another chance, the answer is no.

## The Leadership Bar

I hold leaders (managers, tech leads, staff+ engineers) to a higher standard.

### What I Expect From Leaders

**Ownership.** Leaders own outcomes, not just tasks. When something fails, they do not point fingers.

**Judgment.** Leaders make decisions with incomplete information and can articulate their reasoning.

**Communication.** Leaders communicate clearly up, down, and sideways. They do not hoard information.

**Development.** Leaders develop their people. They are not threatened by growing talent.

**Integrity.** Leaders do what they say they will do. They admit mistakes. They do not play politics.

### What I Will Not Tolerate

**Blame culture.** Leaders who blame their teams for failures.

**Hoarding.** Leaders who keep information or opportunity to maintain power.

**Politics.** Leaders who optimize for their own advancement at the expense of the team or company.

**Stagnation.** Leaders who stop growing, learning, and improving.

### Evaluating Leaders

For managers and tech leads, I look at:
- Team outcomes (are they delivering?)
- Team health (are people engaged, growing, staying?)
- Peer feedback (do other leaders want to work with them?)
- Decision quality (are they making good calls?)

For staff+ engineers:
- Technical impact (are they raising the bar?)
- Influence (are they shaping direction?)
- Mentorship (are they developing others?)
- Judgment (do they know when to push and when to compromise?)

## Succession Planning

Every leadership role should have a succession plan. Not because leaders are going away, but because:
- People get promoted, leave, or take new opportunities
- Teams should not be dependent on any single person
- Identifying successors clarifies what development is needed

I maintain a simple succession matrix:

| Role | Incumbent | Ready Now | Ready in 1 Year | Development Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Team Lead, Platform | [Name] | [Name] | [Name], [Name] | [Name] needs production incident experience |

This is reviewed quarterly and updated as people grow.
