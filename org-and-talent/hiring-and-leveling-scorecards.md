# Hiring and Leveling Scorecards

How I evaluate candidates and calibrate levels consistently.

---

## Philosophy

Hiring is the most important thing a leader does. Every hire changes the team's culture, capability, and trajectory. Bad hires are expensive: they consume management time, demoralize teams, and often have to be managed out.

I use scorecards to reduce bias, increase consistency, and make decisions defensible.

## The Hiring Scorecard

Every candidate is evaluated against the same criteria, scored consistently, and discussed in a structured debrief.

### Scorecard Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Measures | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Technical depth | Expertise in relevant technologies and domains | 25% |
| Problem solving | Ability to break down ambiguous problems and find solutions | 25% |
| System design (senior+) | Ability to design systems at appropriate scale and complexity | 20% |
| Communication | Clarity, listening, and ability to explain technical concepts | 15% |
| Collaboration | Track record of working effectively with others | 10% |
| Values fit | Alignment with how we work (not culture "fit" in the homogeneity sense) | 5% |

Weights vary by role. For staff+ engineers, system design and communication weight higher. For earlier-career engineers, problem solving and technical depth weight higher.

### Scoring

Each dimension is scored on a 4-point scale:

| Score | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | Strong hire | Clear evidence of excellence |
| 3 | Hire | Meets the bar for this role |
| 2 | Weak | Some concerns, may not meet the bar |
| 1 | No hire | Clear evidence this is not the right fit |

**Decision rules:**
- Any dimension scored 1: No hire (unless clear extenuating circumstances)
- Majority of dimensions scored 2: Likely no hire
- Majority of dimensions scored 3+: Likely hire
- Average 3.5+: Strong hire, may consider higher level

### Avoiding Bias

**Use the same criteria for every candidate.** Do not add new criteria because you did not like someone.

**Score before the debrief.** Each interviewer writes their scorecard before discussing with others. This prevents anchoring.

**Focus on evidence, not impressions.** "They seemed smart" is not evidence. "They correctly identified the race condition in the code and explained the fix" is evidence.

**Consider the counterfactual.** Would I score this the same way if the candidate had a different background, school, or employer?

## Leveling Framework

Consistent leveling creates fairness and clarity. People know what is expected of them and what they are working toward.

### Engineering Levels

| Level | Title | Scope | Autonomy | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Software Engineer I | Task | Directed work, close supervision | Individual tasks |
| L2 | Software Engineer II | Feature | Works independently on defined problems | Feature or component |
| L3 | Senior Software Engineer | Project | Leads projects, mentors L1-L2 | Project or system |
| L4 | Staff Software Engineer | Area | Leads technical direction for an area | Team or multiple teams |
| L5 | Principal Software Engineer | Org | Defines technical strategy, broad influence | Engineering org |
| L6 | Distinguished Engineer | Company | Company-wide technical leadership | Company |

### Key Distinctions

**L2 to L3 (Senior):**
- Moves from "completes assigned work" to "owns problems end-to-end"
- Can unblock themselves
- Mentors more junior engineers
- Contributes to technical decisions

**L3 to L4 (Staff):**
- Moves from "owns projects" to "shapes direction"
- Influence beyond their immediate team
- Drives technical strategy, not just execution
- Multiplies the effectiveness of other engineers

**L4 to L5 (Principal):**
- Moves from "team impact" to "org impact"
- Sets technical direction for large areas
- Drives industry-level thinking
- Recognized as a leader across the company

### Leveling Pitfalls

**Title inflation.**
Giving senior titles to keep people happy. This devalues the levels and creates unfair comparisons.

**Tenure-based promotion.**
Promoting because someone has been here long enough. Promotions should be for demonstrated capability, not time served.

**Pedigree-based leveling.**
Leveling a candidate high because they worked at a prestigious company. Level based on demonstrated capability, not resume.

**The "almost" promotion.**
Promoting someone who is "almost" ready. If they are not ready, coach them. Premature promotion sets people up for failure.

## Template

See [Hiring Scorecard Template](../templates/hiring-scorecard-template.md) for the format I use.

## Interview Debrief Process

After all interviews are complete, we hold a structured debrief.

### Format

1. **Independent scoring (before meeting).** Each interviewer completes their scorecard.
2. **Round robin (in meeting).** Each interviewer shares their score and key evidence. No interruptions.
3. **Discussion.** Discuss areas of disagreement. Dig into evidence.
4. **Leveling check.** If hire, what level? Does everyone agree?
5. **Decision.** Hire or no hire. Majority rules if consensus is not reached, but we discuss dissent.

### Rules

- No one speaks twice until everyone has spoken once
- Evidence over impressions
- Disagree openly; do not lobby privately
- Hiring manager makes final call if true tie, but should take dissent seriously

## What I Look For in Staff+ Engineers

Staff and above require more than technical excellence. I look for:

**Strategic thinking.**
Can they see the big picture? Do they understand why we are doing something, not just how?

**Influence without authority.**
Can they drive outcomes through persuasion, not positional power?

**Technical leadership.**
Do other engineers look to them for guidance? Can they raise the bar for the team?

**Judgment.**
Do they make good decisions? Can they navigate ambiguity?

**Delivery.**
Do they ship? Technical excellence without delivery is not valuable.
