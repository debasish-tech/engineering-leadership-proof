# Operating Cadence: Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly

The rhythm of meetings and checkpoints that keeps an engineering org aligned and executing.

---

## Philosophy

Cadence creates predictability. When everyone knows when decisions happen and when status is reviewed, they can focus on work instead of wondering what is going on.

The goal is enough structure to maintain alignment without so much process that it slows people down.

## Weekly Cadence

### Team Standups (15 min, daily or 3x/week)
**Purpose:** Surface blockers, coordinate work, maintain awareness.

**Format:**
- What did I finish?
- What am I working on?
- What is blocking me?

**Rules:**
- Time-boxed. If discussion is needed, take it offline.
- Not a status report to management. This is for the team.

### Manager 1:1s (30 min, weekly)
**Purpose:** Career development, feedback, problem-solving, relationship building.

**Format:**
- Their agenda first (what they want to discuss)
- My agenda second (feedback, context, questions)
- Action items captured

**Rules:**
- Do not cancel. Rescheduling is fine, but repeated cancellations signal that you do not value the person.
- Not a status meeting. Use other forums for status.

### Team Lead Sync (45 min, weekly)
**Purpose:** Cross-team coordination, escalation, decision-making.

**Attendees:** Engineering managers and tech leads.

**Format:**
- Blockers and escalations (15 min)
- Decisions needed (15 min)
- Information sharing (15 min)

**Rules:**
- Come prepared. Read pre-work before the meeting.
- Decisions in the room when possible.

### Engineering All-Hands (30 min, weekly or biweekly)
**Purpose:** Information sharing, recognition, Q&A.

**Format:**
- Key updates from leadership (10 min)
- Team wins and shout-outs (5 min)
- Q&A (15 min)

**Rules:**
- Keep it short. Respect people's time.
- Real Q&A. Do not dodge hard questions.

## Monthly Cadence

### Metrics Review (60 min, monthly)
**Purpose:** Review engineering health metrics, identify trends, decide on interventions.

**Attendees:** Engineering leadership, sometimes cross-functional partners.

**Format:**
- Review scorecard (see [Engineering Metrics Scorecard](./engineering-metrics-scorecard.md))
- Discuss trends (what is improving, what is declining)
- Decide on actions (what are we going to do about it)

**Rules:**
- Data-driven. Opinions are fine, but start with the data.
- Action-oriented. Every concerning trend should have an owner and a plan.

### Leadership 1:1s (60 min, monthly)
**Purpose:** Strategic alignment with my manager, escalations, feedback.

**Format:**
- My update on org health and key initiatives
- Strategic topics and decisions
- Feedback in both directions

### Skip-Level 1:1s (30 min, monthly or quarterly)
**Purpose:** Build relationships with people who report to my direct reports, surface issues that might not bubble up through normal channels.

**Format:**
- Their agenda (what they want to discuss)
- Open questions (how are things going, what would they change)

**Rules:**
- Confidential. Do not report back to their manager unless there is a safety or legal issue.
- Listen more than talk.

---

## Quarterly Cadence

### Quarterly Planning (see [Quarterly Planning and Commitments](./quarterly-planning-and-commitments.md))
**Purpose:** Set goals and commitments for the quarter.

**Duration:** 2 to 3 weeks.

### Quarterly Review (90 min, end of quarter)
**Purpose:** Assess what we accomplished, what we missed, and what we learned.

**Format:**
- Goal-by-goal review (hit, missed, why)
- Key learnings
- Inputs to next quarter planning

**Rules:**
- Honest assessment. Do not spin misses as wins.
- Blameless. Focus on learning, not assigning fault.

### Org Health Check (60 min, quarterly)
**Purpose:** Assess team health, engagement, and retention risk.

**Format:**
- Review engagement survey data (if available)
- Manager assessment of each team
- Identify interventions

**Rules:**
- Confidential. Do not share individual names unless there is a specific concern.
- Action-oriented. Knowing there is a problem without acting is worse than not knowing.

## What I Protect

**Focus time.**
Engineers need uninterrupted time to do deep work. I protect at least one full day per week with no meetings for individual contributors.

**1:1s.**
I do not cancel 1:1s. If I have to reschedule, I reschedule within the same week.

**Planning time.**
Quarterly planning is not optional. I block the time and hold it.
