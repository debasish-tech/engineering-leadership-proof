## What I Bring

### Core Strengths

**Execution at scale**
I run engineering orgs with disciplined planning, clear metrics, and consistent operating cadence. I connect quarterly goals to weekly work.

**Reliability and operational excellence**
I have led reliability turnarounds and built on-call cultures that reduce incidents and improve uptime. I treat reliability as a product feature.

**Org building and talent development**
I hire well, level consistently, and develop leaders. I have built teams from 20 to 150+ across multiple geographies.

**Platform and infrastructure**
I understand platform team dynamics, developer experience, and the build vs buy tradeoffs that platform leaders face.

**Enterprise and regulated environments**
I know how to operate with SOC 2, HIPAA, FDA, and enterprise customer requirements. Compliance is part of how I work, not an afterthought.

### Leadership Style

- Direct communication; I say what I mean
- Data-informed decisions; I measure what matters
- Ownership culture; I expect accountability at all levels
- Development-focused; I invest in growing leaders

## What to Avoid

### Role Types to Skip

| Role | Why |
|---|---|
| Individual contributor | Looking for leadership roles |
| Consulting / advisory | Want to be an operator, not an advisor |
| Very early stage with no team | Need a team to lead |
| Turnaround CEO | Not a C-level generalist role |
| CTO at tiny startup | May be too much of a generalist expectation |

### Company Types to Skip

| Company | Why |
|---|---|
| Companies with toxic culture (known) | Not interested in cleanup without support |
| Companies expecting 80-hour weeks as norm | Sustainable pace matters |
| Companies with no path to profitability | Risk tolerance is moderate |
