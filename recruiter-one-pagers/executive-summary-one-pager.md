## What I Do

I build and run engineering organizations. That means:

- **Org building:** Hiring, leveling, performance management, succession planning
- **Technical leadership:** Platform architecture, build vs buy decisions, debt management

## Key Differentiators

### Proof over pedigree
I hire based on demonstrated capability, not brand names. I apply the same standard to myself. This portfolio contains frameworks, case studies, and templates that show how I operate.

### Reliability ownership
I treat reliability as a product feature, not an ops problem. I have led turnarounds from below-SLA to 99.99%+ uptime.

### Execution discipline
I run operating cadences that connect quarterly goals to weekly work without bureaucratic overhead. I track what matters and act on it.

### Global scale
I have managed distributed teams across 4 continents. I know how to build culture and maintain execution across time zones.
