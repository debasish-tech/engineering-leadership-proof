## Evidence Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your scorecard, verify your evidence:

- [ ] Evidence is specific (not "seemed smart")
- [ ] Evidence is behavioral (what they did, not who they are)
- [ ] Evidence is from this interview (not assumptions from resume)
- [ ] You have evidence for each dimension scored
- [ ] You considered the counterfactual (would you score this the same for a different candidate?)

---

## Anti-Bias Reminders

Before scoring, consider:

**Halo effect:** Are you letting one strong area inflate your scores in other areas?

**Horn effect:** Are you letting one weak area deflate your scores in other areas?

**Similarity bias:** Are you rating the candidate higher because they are similar to you?

**Pedigree bias:** Are you rating the candidate higher because of their employer or school?

**Recency bias:** Are you over-weighting what happened at the end of the interview?

**Confirmation bias:** Are you looking for evidence that confirms your initial impression?
