## Writing Good Key Results

**Do:**
- Use numbers (percentages, counts, time)
- Make them verifiable (someone else can confirm)
- Focus on outcomes, not activities
- Set stretch but achievable targets (70% hit rate is healthy)

**Avoid:**
- Binary key results (launched X) unless truly binary
- Activity metrics (completed N sprints)
- Metrics you cannot measure
- Targets with no baseline

**Examples:**

| Bad | Good |
|---|---|
| Launch new checkout | Increase checkout conversion from X% to Y% |
| Improve monitoring | Reduce mean time to detect from X min to Y min |
| Ship performance improvements | Reduce p95 latency from Xms to Yms |
| Complete reliability project | Achieve Z% uptime for critical services |
