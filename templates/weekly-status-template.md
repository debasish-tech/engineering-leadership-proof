# Weekly Status Template

A template for weekly status updates from engineering teams or leaders.

---

## How to Use This Template

1. Complete by end of day Friday (or your designated status day)
2. Keep it brief. If it takes more than 15 minutes to write, you are writing too much.
3. Focus on what changed this week, not everything that is happening.
4. Highlight risks and blockers clearly. Do not bury them.

- Send on time, every time

**Avoid:**
- Burying bad news at the bottom
- Writing a novel (keep it under 1 page)
- Listing activities without context on outcomes
- Copying the same status week after week without updates
- Waiting until Monday to send Friday's status

**Status colors:**
- Green / On Track: Progressing as planned
- Yellow / At Risk: Some concern, but manageable
- Red / Blocked: Significant issue, needs help
