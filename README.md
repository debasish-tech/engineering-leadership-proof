# Engineering Leadership Proof

A working library of frameworks, systems, and case studies from 22+ years of building and scaling engineering organizations.

This is not a resume. It is an operating system. It shows how I think, how I decide, how I run teams, and how I deliver results.

If you are hiring a Director, Senior Director, or VP of Engineering, this repo gives you proof of capability before the first conversation.

---

## Who This Is For

- **VP/SVP/CTO**: You want to know if I can operate at scale and own outcomes, not just manage people.
- **Executive recruiters** (retained search): You need to quickly assess fit for Director+ searches.
- **Founders and VCs** (Series B to E): You want an operator who builds systems, not someone who coasts on brand names.
- **Enterprise hiring panels** (Fortune 500): You want proof that I can handle complexity, compliance, and global scale.

## How to Read This

### If you are a CTO or VP of Engineering
Start with [Proof Narratives](./proof-narratives/) to see real outcomes. Then review [Decision Frameworks](./decision-frameworks/) to understand how I approach hard tradeoffs. Finally, check [Execution System](./execution-system/) for how I run operating cadence.

**Time: 15 minutes**

### If you are an Executive Recruiter (Retained Search)
Start with [Recruiter One-Pagers](./recruiter-one-pagers/) for a fast summary of target roles, scope, and differentiators. Then skim [Quick Intro](./00-start-here/quick-intro.md) and one proof narrative.

**Time: 8 minutes**

### If you are an Enterprise Hiring Panel
Review [Risk and Reliability](./risk-and-reliability/) for how I handle incidents, postmortems, and security. Then check [Org and Talent](./org-and-talent/) for how I build and evaluate teams at scale.

**Time: 20 minutes**

### If you are a Founder or VC
Start with [Pedigree to Proof](./00-start-here/pedigree-to-proof.md) to understand my hiring philosophy. Then read [Platform Team Models](./decision-frameworks/platform-team-models.md) and [Quarterly Planning](./execution-system/quarterly-planning-and-commitments.md).
