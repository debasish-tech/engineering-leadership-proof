# Pedigree to Proof

This document explains my stance on hiring, evaluation, and credibility in engineering leadership.

## The Problem with Pedigree

The tech industry has a pedigree problem. We over-weight brand names: which companies you worked at, which schools you attended, which investors backed you. We use these as shortcuts for capability because real evaluation is hard.

This creates bad outcomes:

- **Talented people get filtered out.** Engineers from non-traditional backgrounds never get a fair shot because their resumes do not have the right logos.
- **Mediocre people get promoted.** Being in the room at a successful company is not the same as creating that success.
- **Homogeneity compounds.** Pedigree-based hiring selects for people who look and think like the people already in the room.
- **Performance surprises.** Leaders who interviewed well but cannot execute often reveal themselves only after significant damage is done.

## Proof Over Pedigree

I believe in proof over pedigree. That means:

**In hiring:**
I evaluate candidates on what they have actually done, not where they did it. I look for specifics: What was the situation? What did you do? What was the measurable result? What would you do differently?

I do not care if you worked at a FAANG company. I care if you can articulate how you solved a hard problem and what you learned from it.

**In evaluation:**
I hold myself to the same standard. This repo exists because I believe my track record should be evaluable before you talk to me. I am showing you my frameworks, my decisions, and my results. You can decide if that is valuable.

**In team building:**
I build teams with diverse backgrounds because pedigree-based hiring leaves talent on the table. The best engineer I ever hired had a community college degree and a portfolio of side projects that demonstrated more capability than most Stanford grads I interviewed.

## What Proof Looks Like

Proof is specific, measurable, and verifiable. Here is the difference:

| Pedigree Statement | Proof Statement |
|---|---|
| "I led engineering at a high-growth startup" | "I scaled the team from 8 to 45 engineers over 18 months while shipping 3 major product launches" |
| "I worked on reliability at a major cloud provider" | "I reduced P0 incidents by X% over Y months by implementing on-call rotation changes and runbook automation" |
| "I have experience with large-scale systems" | "I owned a platform serving X million daily active users with Y% uptime over Z period" |

The second column is harder to fake. It is also harder to achieve. That is the point.

## Applying This to My Own Candidacy

I expect hiring managers to evaluate me the same way I evaluate others. That is why I built this repo.

If you want to know whether I can:
- Make good decisions under uncertainty: read my [decision frameworks](../decision-frameworks/)
- Run an engineering org with discipline: read my [execution system](../execution-system/)
- Handle reliability and incidents: read my [risk and reliability docs](../risk-and-reliability/)
- Build and develop talent: read my [org and talent docs](../org-and-talent/)
- Deliver results: read my [proof narratives](../proof-narratives/)

You can form a judgment before we ever speak. That is the point.

## The Tradeoff

Proof-based evaluation is slower upfront. It requires more thought, more documentation, and more honest assessment. It is easier to scan resumes for brand names.

But proof-based evaluation reduces hiring mistakes, improves team quality, and builds organizations that actually perform. The upfront investment pays off.
