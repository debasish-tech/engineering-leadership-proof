# Leadership Principles

These are the principles I operate by. They are not aspirational. They are what I actually do.

## On Execution

**Ship early, learn fast, fix immediately.**
Speed matters, but so does learning. The goal is not to ship fast. The goal is to shorten the loop between decision and feedback.

**Commit to outcomes, not tasks.**
Teams own results, not activity. If the work is done but the outcome is not achieved, we failed.

**Make decisions with incomplete data.**
Waiting for certainty is a decision to be slow. Document what you know, what you assume, and what would change your mind.

**Finish what you start.**
Half-done work is worse than not started. If something is not worth finishing, kill it explicitly. Do not let it rot.

## On Teams

**Hire for capability, not credentials.**
The best engineers I have hired did not have the fanciest pedigrees. They had proof of what they could do.

**Small teams own big problems.**
Large teams diffuse accountability. Small teams with clear ownership move faster and care more.

**Managers are not middlemen.**
A manager who only relays information up and down is a bottleneck. Managers add value by making decisions, removing blockers, and developing people.

**Direct feedback is a kindness.**
Avoiding hard conversations is not nice. It is negligent. Give feedback early, clearly, and with the intent to help.

## On Reliability

**Reliability is not optional.**
Customers do not care why you are down. They care that you are down. Build reliability into how you work, not as an afterthought.

**Every incident is a system failure.**
Blaming individuals is lazy. The question is: what in our system allowed this to happen, and how do we fix it?

**On-call is a first-class job.**
If on-call is miserable, the product is broken. Fix the product.

**Postmortems without follow-through are theater.**
A postmortem that does not change anything is worse than no postmortem. It makes everyone feel like they did something when they did not.

---

## On Decisions

**Default to reversible decisions.**
If a decision is easy to undo, make it fast. Save deliberation for one-way doors.

**Write it down.**
Decisions made in meetings but not documented do not exist. Write the decision, the reasoning, and who owns the follow-up.

**Disagree and commit.**
Once a decision is made, execute fully. Undermining decisions you disagreed with is toxic.

**Own your mistakes publicly.**
Leaders who hide their errors teach their teams to hide theirs. Admit mistakes, fix them, and move on.

---

## On Growth

**Build leaders, not followers.**
Your job is to make yourself unnecessary. If your team cannot function without you, you have failed.

**Stretch people on purpose.**
Comfort is the enemy of growth. Give people problems slightly bigger than they think they can handle.

**Succession is not optional.**
Every leadership role should have a clear succession path. If you get hit by a bus, your team should not collapse.
