# Quick Intro

I am an engineering leader with 22+ years of experience building and scaling software organizations.

## What I Do

I run engineering organizations. That means I own outcomes: shipping products, keeping systems running, building teams that can operate without me, and making hard decisions when the data is incomplete.

I have done this at enterprise scale (platforms serving 60M+ users) and at earlier stages where speed matters more than process. I have managed global teams across four continents. I have owned P&L for infrastructure budgets in the tens of millions.

## What I Believe

**Proof over pedigree.** I hire based on demonstrated capability, not brand names on resumes. I expect the same standard applied to me.

**Systems over heroics.** Good engineering orgs do not depend on individual heroes. They depend on clear ownership, consistent execution, and processes that scale.

**Reliability is a feature.** Uptime is not an ops problem. It is a product problem. I build organizations where reliability is owned by the people who build the product.

**Debt is a choice.** Technical debt is not inherently bad. Ignoring it is bad. Every debt decision should be conscious, tracked, and revisited.

## What I Have Built

- Engineering organizations from 20 to 150+ people across multiple geographies
- Platform teams that serve internal customers (developers, QA, data) as real customers
- Incident response and on-call cultures that reduce repeat incidents by double digits
- Hiring systems that reduce mis-hires and build diverse, high-performing teams
- Execution systems that connect quarterly goals to weekly work without bureaucratic overhead

## Why This Repo Exists

I got tired of explaining myself in 30-minute screening calls. This repo is a working library of how I think and operate. If you want to know whether I can do the job, start here.
